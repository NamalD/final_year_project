# final_year_project

Java program to match AI bots against other bots or human players, in two-player games such as Tic-Tac-Toe. Uses a predicate logic base defined using SWI-Prolog to describe games as a set of fluent and action predicates.

Currently contains a bot which makes random legal game moves, and another which uses the Monte-Carlo Tree Search to make decisions, as well as support for a human player.
Games that have been pre-defined are Tic-Tac-Toe and Go (not fully complete).
